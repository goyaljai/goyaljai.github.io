# Aangan - Premium Stones & Marbles Website

This is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic for the product grid, modal, cart, and bidding system.

## How to Host on GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**:
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new public repository (e.g., `aangan-website`).

2.  **Upload Files**:
    - Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to the root of your repository.
    - You can do this via the command line or the GitHub web interface.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Go to your repository **Settings**.
    - Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar.
    - Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
    - Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`.
    - Click **Save**.

4.  **Visit Your Site**:
    - After a minute or two, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/aangan-website/`.
